<!-- 
	The GWT file allows GWT projects to use the SoPeCo Service layer. For example the SoPeCo
	WebUI is a GWT projects.
	GWT projects depends on projects to provide information about files, which are used in the
	GWT project to have perfect cooperation between the GWT project and this project.
	This module file references to packages, where all the files are, which needs to be translated
	into JavaScript by GWT, because they are mostly dependencies in the GWT project.
	
	Be aware, that in addition all source files of the project (pure .java files) are provided
	in the packed jar, which is in the maven repository afterwards. So dependent GWT project
	does NOT need to include this service layer into their Java build path and only need the
	maven dependency to this project.

  		All the database elements are referenced.

  		However, GWT automatically analyses subdirectories and finds the needed classes.
